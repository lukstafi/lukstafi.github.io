# Lowest hanging fruit of TeXmacs greatness for VSCode

An extension to directly WYSIWYG-style edit equations, with rendering through KaTeX, and key bindings.

The high-bar ideal is to approach the usability of TeXmacs. So eg. we will use more braces than necessary for rendering, to keep track of the structure of formulas. The key bindings will be strictly compatible with [Navi Parens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lukstafi.navi-parens), and compatible with TeXmacs where that is also most ergonomic.

Two extensions that look relevant:
- [Fast Unicode Math Characters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GuidoTapia2.unicode-math-vscode&ssr=false#overview)
- [Ultra Math Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yfzhao.ultra-math-preview)
