## Don't forget

* Use Valgrind to debug memory corruption.
  * Symptoms: random crashes in garbage collection, in `ctypes` code, in system libraries etc.
  * Example invocation: `valgrind --leak-check=full --leak-resolution=high --show-leak-kinds=all --errors-for-leak-kinds=none _build/default/bin/example.exe`
* Use GDB when the program hangs to quickly see the stack trace.
* If you use `landmarks` to compare performances of parts within a program run: it seems that the optional wallclock timer is not reset properly between restarts.
